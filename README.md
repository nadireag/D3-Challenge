# D3-Challenge

### D3 Dabbler

Use the data.csv file to create a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as `Healthcare vs. Poverty` or `Smokers vs. Age`.

Using the D3 techniques, create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements.

* Include state abbreviations in the circles.

* Create and situate the axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.
